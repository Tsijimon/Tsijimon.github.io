Hello.
I will be doing my review on my favorite movie. It will be a quick, short one.
<br>
My review will be on Lord of the Rings.
<br>
I really enjoyed this film. It has an excellent sense of scale, an excellent soundtrack and score. Outstanding composition. It is based off a fantasy epic that changed the world of fiction and fantasy forever.
<br>
The movie itself displays excellent effects, brilliant storytelling and dialogue and was overall faithful to the book.
I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in it. 
<br>

Thank you
