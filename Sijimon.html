<h2>Favorite Hobbies and Activities</h2>
<p>My favorite hobbies and activities include basketball, corporate and political activism, creative writing and video gaming. Basketball has been a beloved sport for me to play since I was in middle school; ironically it was a basketball video game that convinced me to play the sport, and I ended up loving it for many years. My corporate and political activism includes activities such as emailing campaigns urging legislators to vote certain ways on relevant matters to myself and the various groups I associate with, and to corporations concerning the currently topic of censorship. Video games has been a much-beloved hobby for me since I was a child; I focus on niche games, games journalism, and relevant topics of interest to me in the industry. Creative writing is a hobby I dabble more on occasion; I've enjoyed reading about incredible fantasy worlds involving dwarfs and elves and giants and I couldn't help but desire to create my own stories when I feel the urge as a result.
